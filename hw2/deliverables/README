EECE6036 Homework 2

* * * * * * Directory Structure * * * * * *

This project has the following directory structure:
<base directory>/
  code/
    data.txt
    <python source files>
  data/
    <generated data>
  images/
    <generated images>

* * * * * * Running the Code * * * * * *

It runs in Python 3, but I specifically tested it with Python 3.6.9.
It will NOT run in Python 2.

To run the each file, run the following command from the code/ directory:

python3 <file_name>

Note: Depending on how you installed Python, you might replace python3 with
python

To run the code for problem 1, run the files knn.py and neighborhood.py.
To run the code for problem 2, run the file perceptron.py.
To run the code for problem 3, run the file problem_3.py.

The file dataset.py is used to manage the dataset, and will generate a plot
of the dataset points if run. It is not necessary to run it.

The file classifier.py is an abstract class for common functions of the
algorithms. It will not produce anything if run.

Running the code will create a new directory in the base directory of the
project called images/ and populate it with the figures used in the report.
It will also generate the data/ directory and populate it with misc. data
files.

* * * * * * Dependencies * * * * * *

The following are the package dependencies.
  - numpy (1.19.2)
  - matplotlib (3.3.1)
It is very likely that they are already installed, but if the file will not
run, run the following command from the base directory of the project:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Note: Depending on how you installed Python, you might replace pip3 with pip.
