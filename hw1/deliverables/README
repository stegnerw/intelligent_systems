EECE6036 Homework 1

This project has the following directory structure:
<base directory>/
  code/
    spiking_neuron.py
  images/
    <generated images>

It runs in Python 3, but I specifically tested it with Python 3.6.9.
It will NOT run in Python 2.

To run the project, run the following command from the code/ directory:

python3 spiking_neuron.py

Note: Depending on how you installed Python, you might replace python3 with
python

Running the code will create a new directory in the base directory of the
project called images/ and populate it with the figures used in the report.

The following are the package dependencies.
  - numpy (1.19.2)
  - matplotlib (3.3.1)
It is very likely that they are already installed, but if the file will not
run, run the following command from the base directory of the project:

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Note: Depending on how you installed Python, you might replace pip3 with pip.
